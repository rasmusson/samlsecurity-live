As a widely used standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, SAML ensures secure and seamless user authentication across disparate systems.\nIn this quick tutorial we will look at the how to set up a simple SAML Service provider using PySAML to talk to mocksaml.dev as IdP.\nIntroduction First lets quickly look into some of the basics of SAML and PySAML.\nQuick recap on SAML SAML serves as a foundation for enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities, allowing users to access multiple applications through a single set of credentials. It facilitates secure exchanges of authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).\nThe primary components of a SAML transaction include:\nIdentity Provider (IdP): Manages user identities and authentication processes. Service Provider (SP): Hosts the applications/services users want to access. The SP requests a user to be authenticated by the IdP and get a Authentication Response back as a proof authentication.\nHow PySAML2 Simplifies Authentication PySAML2 abstracts the complexities of SAML protocols, providing a Python-based framework to seamlessly integrate SAML-based authentication into applications. It empowers developers to:\nEffortlessly Implement SAML: With PySAML2, developers can focus on application logic while the library handles the intricate SAML protocol details. Enable Secure Authentication: Ensure secure and reliable authentication mechanisms, meeting the stringent security requirements of modern applications. Facilitate Interoperability: PySAML2 adheres to the SAML standard, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across various identity providers and service providers. Key Benefits of PySAML2 Robust Security Measures: PySAML2 incorporates robust security features, including encryption and digital signatures, to fortify authentication processes. Flexible Integration: Seamlessly integrate SAML-based authentication into Flask, Django, and other Python frameworks. Comprehensive Protocol Support: Support for SAML 2.0 and its various profiles, enabling comprehensive SSO capabilities. Ad Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nDigging in The PySAML sample below is a minimal sample of a PySAML usage, with all the shortcuts, just to get PySAML up andd running as simple as possible so showcase it. For example\nNo signatures are done or required Unsolicited responses are allowed No encryption or anything All of this can pose security problems and should be addressed in anything used for more than a demo like this. Those topics is or will be covered in the rest of my series on PySAML.\nTo setup this small sample we will look att three parts of the typical PySAML application\nService configuration: the configuration defining the service PySAML is running. In this case the SP. Metadata: The metadata of the part we are talking to. In this case the mocksaml.dev IdP The python application code using PySAML Now PySAML it self does not itself handle any redirection of use or receiving of responses. It just does the base work of SAML. To make this a bit more of a complete sample I use flask to be the web server and handle this.\nPrerequisites Before digging in to PySAML2 into your Flask application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:\nFlask Framework: PySAML2 integrates seamlessly with Flask. Install Flask by running pip install flask. xmlsec1 Library: For cryptographic operations, install xmlsec1 based on your system requirements. On Ubuntu/Debian, use sudo apt-get install xmlsec1. PySAML itself: Install by running pip install pysaml2\nService configuration The first part we will look at here is the service configuration\n1from saml2.config import Config 2from saml2 import config as saml_config 3from saml2.saml import NAMEID_FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED 4 5# SP Configuration 6SP_CONFIG = { 7 \u0026#34;entityid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:example:sp\u0026#34;, 8 \u0026#34;service\u0026#34;: { 9 \u0026#34;sp\u0026#34;: { 10 \u0026#34;want_response_signed\u0026#34;: False, 11 \u0026#34;want_assertions_signed\u0026#34;: False, 12 \u0026#34;name_id_format\u0026#34;: NAMEID_FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED, 13 \u0026#34;endpoints\u0026#34;: { 14 \u0026#34;assertion_consumer_service\u0026#34;: [ 15 (\u0026#34;http://localhost:8000/acs\u0026#34;, saml_config.BINDING_HTTP_POST) 16 ] 17 }, 18 \u0026#34;allow_unsolicited\u0026#34;: True, 19 \u0026#34;require_signed_assertion\u0026#34;: False, 20 \u0026#34;require_signed_response\u0026#34;: False 21 } 22 23 }, 24 \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { 25 \u0026#34;local\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;metadata.xml\u0026#34;] 26 } 27} The service configuration above shows a simple example of the configuration of the service run by PySAML. For simplicity and demoing we say that we don't want or require signing. 1\u0026#34;service\u0026#34;: { 2 \u0026#34;sp\u0026#34;: { 3 \u0026#34;want_response_signed\u0026#34;: False, 4 \u0026#34;want_assertions_signed\u0026#34;: False, 5... 6 \u0026#34;require_signed_assertion\u0026#34;: False, 7 \u0026#34;require_signed_response\u0026#34;: False, We also defines that it is ok with unsolicited responses. 1\u0026#34;allow_unsolicited\u0026#34;: True\nThe endpoint definition tells the IdP where to send the resulting authentication response 1\u0026#34;endpoints\u0026#34;: { 2 \u0026#34;assertion_consumer_service\u0026#34;: [ 3 (\u0026#34;http://localhost:8000/acs\u0026#34;, saml_config.BINDING_HTTP_POST) 4 ] 5}\nand we refer to our IdP Metadata in the metadata.xml explained in the next section. 1\u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { 2 \u0026#34;local\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;metadata.xml\u0026#34;] 3}\nIdP Metadata Next lets look at the IdP metadata describing the mocksaml IdP\n1\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\u0026#34; cacheDuration=\u0026#34;PT1701351683S\u0026#34; entityID=\u0026#34;samlmock.dev\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;md:IDPSSODescriptor WantAuthnRequestsSigned=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; protocolSupportEnumeration=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;md:NameIDFormat\u0026gt;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified\u0026lt;/md:NameIDFormat\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;md:SingleSignOnService Binding=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect\u0026#34; Location=\u0026#34;https://samlmock.dev/idp\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;/md:IDPSSODescriptor\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/md:EntityDescriptor\u0026gt; The XML above shows a typical example of a simple metadata for a IdP. The IdP, in this case accepts authentication requests that are not signed, do for simplicity's sake we use a metadata without keys and with the attribute 1WantAuthnRequestsSigned=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;, that states that the IdP does not want it singed.\nOther than that it mainly says that the binding HTTP Redirect should be used to send the authentication request.\nApplication code Now finally lets look at the application code doing the lifting\n1from sp_config import SP_CONFIG 2 3config = saml_config.Config() 4config.load(SP_CONFIG) 5app = Flask(__name__) 6sp = Saml2Client(config=config) Some basic initiation. We loud our service configuration in SP_CONFIG and initiate a SAML2 client from it. Also initiate the flask app\n1@app.route(\u0026#39;/login\u0026#39;) 2def login(): 3 request_id, authn_request = sp.prepare_for_authenticate() 4 headers = dict(authn_request[\u0026#39;headers\u0026#39;]) 5 return redirect(headers[\u0026#39;Location\u0026#39;]) A simple endpoint in flask that creates the authentication response and then redirects the user to the IdP along with it.\n1@app.route(\u0026#39;/acs\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;]) 2def acs(): 3 authn_response = sp.parse_authn_request_response(request.form[\u0026#39;SAMLResponse\u0026#39;], saml_config.BINDING_HTTP_POST) 4 print(authn_response) 5 return redirect(\u0026#39;/success\u0026#39; if authn_response else \u0026#39;/error\u0026#39;) A flask endpoint acting as the Assertion Consumer Service, receiving the Authentication Response from IdP, when the user is sent back. The SAML Response is send as a form parameter in a POST request. The SAML response is printed to the console The user is then redirected to the success page\n1@app.route(\u0026#39;/success\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;]) 2def success(): 3 return \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Authentication successful!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; The final success page indicating that the user was successfully authenticated.\nAd Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nGet it on Github and try it out!

This is done using a Keycloak server to act as a broker and translate between OIDC and SAML. I will show the necessary configuration needed and as a cherry on top show you how to automate the whole setup.\nThe problem with SAML in SPA in browser application “No, you can’t use SAML in a Single Page Application.”\n“SAML is old. Why don’t you just change to OIDC.”\nI have seen many questions on the subject and this is most often the kind of answers you find if you start looking around on how to let you users login to SAML IdP from SPAs like React or Angular.\nIt is true that you can't use SAML directly from the SPA running in the browser. This is because SAML relies heavily on public/private key pairs of the parties involved to do message signing and encryption and a SPA in the browser can not give the protection needed for these.\nSAML also involves other mechanisms like automatically posting forms that does not translate well to a in browser application.\nIn conclusion, SAML was not designed to be used for things like SPAs. It was designed for a classic, old school, thick backend server - client setup. OIDC on the other hand is a more modern protocol that fit this use case perfectly.\nHowever, the reality is that many organizations have relied on SAML for along time and it is not unusual to see this being the only supported protocol for the existing identity provider.\nBrokered authentication using Keycloak One way to solve this dilemma is to use a broker authentication pattern.\nInstead of just using OIDC or just using SAML, the SPA uses OIDC, the IdP uses SAML and we place Keycloak as a broker between to translate.\nThe SPA in the browser redirects the user with an OIDC request to Keycloak Keycloak receives the user and request, crafts a SAML request and send it and the user to ADFS IdP for authentication Ones the user is authenticated ADFS send a SAML response and user back to Keycloak. Keycloak receives the SAML response, interprets it and uses it to craft a OIDC response and respond to the original OIDC request from the React SPA. Setting it up When I prepared this, I created configuration and scripts in Vagrant to set up the a demo environment automatically. The automated setup is available here on Github. At the end of the article I have some more information on how to use it.\nWhile walking through the configuration I will show how to configure everything in the UI interfaces as well as using the command line.\nBelow we will look on the four steps needed\nSetting up Keycloak to use OIDC towards React SPA Setting up the React demo application SAML integration between ADFS and Keycloak Configure brokering between OIDC and SAML Ad Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nSetting up Keycloak to use OIDC towards React SPA Provided you have set up your Keycloak, lets dive in and configure OIDC!\nBrowse to https://keycloak:8443/auth/admin/ and login as admin.\nCreate a realm for the OIDC integration\nCreate a client for the React SPA. On the first screen, just input a name for the client and click create.\nOn this next screen add a redirect URL for your SPA. In my case Im setting up a demo React app below with redirect URL \u0026quot;http://react:3000\u0026quot;\nUnder Web Origins, type a plus sign. Do not click the plus sign, but type a plus sign in the field. This will add all your redirect URLs in allowed origins and avoid CORS problems.\nNow lets configure the client to use PKCE. This is best practice when working with SPAs and other applications that can not protect a secret key.\nMake sure \u0026quot;Access Type\u0026quot; is set to public and that \u0026quot;Standard Flow Enabled\u0026quot; is set to On.\nNext expand the Advanced settings and set \u0026quot;Proof Key for Code Exchange Code Challenge Method\u0026quot; to S256\nTo do this using the Keycloak CLI 1kcadm.sh create realms -s realm=oidcrealm -s enabled=true 2 3kcadm.sh create clients -r oidcrealm -f - \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF 4{\u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;oidc-client\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;redirectUris\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;http://react:3000\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;webOrigins\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;+\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;standardFlowEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;publicClient\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;pkce.code.challenge.method\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;S256\u0026#34;}} 5EOF\nSetting up the React demo application Now its time to configure the React application to authenticate users using OIDC. In this tutorial I'm using my own OIDC demo app. The application is available here on Github How to set up another app will vary depending on what framework you are using, but you will need to get and configure the OIDC endpoint for Keycloak. For our current setup the endpoint will be these\nauthorizeEndpoint: https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth tokenEndpoint: https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/token logoutEndpoint: https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/logout To configure the React demo app, clone the repo and run npm install.\n1git clone https://github.com/rasmusson/react-oidc-pkce-demo 2cd react-oidc-pkce-demo 3npm install Now open src/SecuredApp.js and edit the configuration in AuthService to match your endpoints, client name and redirect URI. In our case it will look like this.\n1const authService = new AuthService({ 2 clientId: \u0026#39;oidc-client\u0026#39;, 3 authorizeEndpoint: \u0026#39;https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth\u0026#39;, 4 tokenEndpoint: \u0026#39;https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/token\u0026#39;, 5 logoutEndpoint: \u0026#39;https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/logout\u0026#39;, 6 redirectUri: \u0026#39;http://react:3000\u0026#39;, 7 scopes: [\u0026#39;openid\u0026#39;], 8}); Next start the React app\n1npm start To test that the OIDC integration works fine, lets create a test user in Keycloak and authenticate.\nSave and then, set a password for the user as below\nI disable temporary password as this is for demo purposes.\nTo create the test user using Keycloak CLI 1kcadm.sh create users -r oidcrealm -s username=test -s enabled=true -o --fields id,username 2kcadm.sh set-password -r oidcrealm --username test --new-password test\nBrowse to where your React app is running, in my case http://react:3000/ and click the Login button\nLogin using the new test user\nYou should get a JWT token with user information as a result.\nAd Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nSAML integration between ADFS and Keycloak Next step is to set up a authentication provider in Keycloak to authenticate users against the ADFS IdP.\nIn Keycloak, create a new SAML authentication provider\nConfiguration may differ in different environments. In this demo we will set the following\nSync Mode: Import - Meaning we import the user data coming from the IdP ones, when the user is first authenticated. Single Sign-On Service URL: https://adfs.devel/adfs/ls/ - Where our ADFS endpoint for SSO is. Single Logout Service URL: https://adfs.devel/adfs/ls/ - Where our ADFS endpoint for SLO is. Want AuthnRequests Signed: On - To sign authentication request and especially singing single logout requests which is mandatory by default in ADFS. NameID Policy Format: Email - This is how we will identify users To configure the SAML IdP using Keycloak CLI 1kcadm.sh create identity-provider/instances -r oidcrealm -s alias=saml -s providerId=saml -s enabled=true -s config.wantAuthnRequestsSigned=true -s config.allowedClockSkew=10 -s \u0026#39;config.useJwksUrl=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026#39; -s config.singleSignOnServiceUrl=https://adfs.devel/adfs/ls/ -s config.singleLogoutServiceUrl=https://adfs.devel/adfs/ls/ -s config.nameIDPolicyFormat=urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress -s config.signatureAlgorithm=RSA_SHA256\nConfigure Keycloak as relaying party in ADFS When setting up Keycloak as a SP in ADFS, we need to import Metadata. The metadata contains connection and communication information that ADFS needs.\nFirst lets download the metadata from Keycloak. At the ADFS server, browse to https://keycloak:8443/auth/realms/oidcrealm/broker/saml/endpoint/descriptor. Click through the HTTPS warnings and download the file.\nOpen up ADFS administration, and add a relying party. Choose Claims aware. Use the option \u0026quot;Import data about the relying party from a file\u0026quot; and browse to you file.\nNormally the metadata is simplest imported by using the option \u0026quot;Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network\u0026quot; to let ADFS fetch the metadata directly from Keycloak. This requires the TLS trust is setup correctly. I have not bothered to do that for this demo so I use this method instead.\nSet a name, for example Keycloak\nNext we set which users are allowed to authenticate thought the integration. As this is a demo, we make it simple and set it to everyone. Select \u0026quot;Permit everyone\u0026quot;\nThen click next, next and finish\nAfter you finish, the dialog \u0026quot;Edit Claims Issuance Policy for Keycloak\u0026quot; should open. Here we configure what information will be sent to Keycloak together with the user when it has been authenticated. In Keycloak we configured the user to be identified by email, so now we must configure ADFS to send the email address of the authenticated user.\nFirst we create a rule to get a the email as a claim.\nSelect \u0026quot;Send LDAP Attributes as Claims\u0026quot;.

Digital signatures allow the receiver of a message to be sure that the message has not changed since it was sent by the sender. If not for digital signatures someone in the middle of the SAML communication could for example change what user was authenticated in the SAML assertion from the IdP.\nDigital signatures are also used to authenticate the sender sending a message.\nGetting credentials for signing and verification In the examples below we use credentials, being keys and certificates used for signing and verification. Lets first have a look on ways to get the credentials.\nIn OpenSAML 4 and other versions of OpenSAML, credentials are read using credential resolvers that resolve credentials from a source based on defined criterion. There are different credential resolvers that fetch credentials from different places. Two popular resolvers are KeyStoreCredentialResolver and MetadataCredentialResolver.\nKeyStoreCredentialResolver KeyStoreCredentialResolver resolves credentials from a Java keystore file. The KeyStoreCredentialResolver takes a KeyStore object and a map containing the passwords for the entries in the key store.\nFirst read the create a KeyStore object from a Java key store file. 1KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType()); 2InputStream inputStream = this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(pathToKeyStore); 3keystore.load(inputStream, keyStore\tPassword.toCharArray()); 4inputStream.close();\nCreate KeyStoreCredentialResolver and resolve the a credential based on criteria 1Map\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; passwordMap = new HashMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt;(); 2passwordMap.put(ENTITY_ID, KEY_STORE_ENTRY_PASSWORD); 3 4KeyStoreCredentialResolver resolver = new KeyStoreCredentialResolver(keystore, passwordMap); 5 6Criterion criterion = new EntityIdCriterion(ENTITY_ID); 7CriteriaSet criteriaSet = new CriteriaSet(); 8criteriaSet.add(criterion); 9Credential cred = resolver.resolveSingle(criteriaSet); Ad Want to quickly learn and understand OpenSAML?\nHave a look on the book A guide to OpenSAML!\nThe criteria used above represents the entity id of the party that we are fetching credentials for. The resolver will fetch entries in the JKS with the same name as the entity id.\nIn the examples above the following command was used to produce the keystore.\n1keytool -keystore senderKeystore.jks -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias sender.example.com MetadataCredentialResolver Another popular resolver is the MetadataCredentialResolver. This resolved public keys as credentials from SAML Metadata.\nFirst create and initialize the FilesystemMetadataResolver to get the metadata file. 1File metadataFile = new File(getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(SENDER_METADATA_PATH).toURI()); 2 3final FilesystemMetadataResolver metadataResolver = new FilesystemMetadataResolver(metadataFile); 4metadataResolver.setId(metadataResolver.getClass().getCanonicalName()); 5metadataResolver.setParserPool(OpenSAMLUtils.getParserPool()); 6metadataResolver.initialize();\nCreate and init MetadataCredentialResolver. A RoleDescriptorResolver and KeyInfoCredentialResolver is added to find the right entity id in the metadata file and extract the keys. 1final MetadataCredentialResolver metadataCredentialResolver = new MetadataCredentialResolver(); 2 3final PredicateRoleDescriptorResolver roleResolver = new PredicateRoleDescriptorResolver(metadataResolver); 4 5final KeyInfoCredentialResolver keyResolver = DefaultSecurityConfigurationBootstrap .buildBasicInlineKeyInfoCredentialResolver(); 6 7metadataCredentialResolver.setKeyInfoCredentialResolver(keyResolver); 8metadataCredentialResolver.setRoleDescriptorResolver(roleResolver); 9 10metadataCredentialResolver.initialize(); 11roleResolver.initialize();\nFinally, resolve the public key from metadata using criterion. 1CriteriaSet criteriaSet = new CriteriaSet(); 2criteriaSet.add(new UsageCriterion(UsageType.SIGNING)); 3criteriaSet.add(new EntityRoleCriterion(SPSSODescriptor.DEFAULT_ELEMENT_NAME)); 4criteriaSet.add(new ProtocolCriterion(SAMLConstants.SAML20P_NS)); 5criteriaSet.add(new EntityIdCriterion(SENDER_ENTITY_ID)); 6 7Credential credential = metadataCredentialResolver.resolveSingle(criteriaSet);\nSigning messages OpenSAML is a very low level library forcing the developer to do a lot themselves, for example signing messages.\nMessage signing in OpenSAML 4 is done using message handlers. Message handlers can do a lot of the surrounding work needed before sending a message or after receiving one. This work can for example be signing and verifying digital signatures, validating time validity of a message and checking that the message was intended for the receiver.\nSigning is done using the SAMLOutboundProtocolMessageSigningHandler, but It also needs information about how to sign. This information is stored in a message context SecurityParametersContext containing signature signing parameters.\nFirst lets create the signature signing parameters 1SignatureSigningParameters signingParameters = new SignatureSigningParameters(); 2signingParameters.setSigningCredential(getSenderSigningCredential()); 3signingParameters.setSignatureAlgorithm(SignatureConstants.ALGO_ID_SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA256); 4signingParameters.setSignatureReferenceDigestMethod(SignatureConstants.ALGO_ID_DIGEST_SHA256); 5signingParameters.setSignatureCanonicalizationAlgorithm(SignatureConstants.ALGO_ID_C14N_EXCL_OMIT_COMMENTS); Ad Want to quickly learn and understand OpenSAML?\nHave a look on the book A guide to OpenSAML!\nAnd add it to the message context 1MessageContext context = new MessageContext(); 2context.getSubcontext(SecurityParametersContext.class, true) 3.setSignatureSigningParameters(signingParameters);\nAnd finally sign the message using SAMLOutboundProtocolMessageSigningHandler 1SAMLOutboundProtocolMessageSigningHandler handler = new SAMLOutboundProtocolMessageSigningHandler(); 2handler.setSignErrorResponses(false); 3handler.initialize(); 4handler.invoke(context);\nThe SAMLOutboundProtocolMessageSigningHandler will calculate a signature based on the parameters in the SignatureSigningParameters and add the signature to the XML message.\nValidating signatures In OpenSAML many features are manual and dependent on that the developer uses them, this is also true for both signing and verifying signatures. If verification is not done in your use of OpenSAML, you will simply go ahead and use the message without having verified the message, leading to all kinds of security issues.\nThere are several ways to verify a signature in OpenSAML. The most straightforward and easy to understand is using SignatureValidator\nFirst the signature is checked to follow certain security rules of the SAML signature format. The signature is then cryptographically verified against a credential. 1SAMLSignatureProfileValidator profileValidator = new SAMLSignatureProfileValidator(); 2profileValidator.validate(message.getSignature()); 3SignatureValidator.validate(message.getSignature(), credential);\nThis works well but involves writing extra code for different things, for example getting the certificate to use for validation\nA more modern approach as introduced in OpenSAML 3 and also in OpenSAML 4 is to use message handlers.\nVerifying signatures using message handler and trust engine The SAMLProtocolMessageXMLSignatureSecurityHandler is used to verify signatures. As with the message handler for signing messages, this one also needs information in the message context saying how to verify the signature.\nFor signature verification in message handlers, the whole logic for verifying signatures is delegated to a trust engine which encapsulates this.\nTrust engines is a more advanced way of verifying signatures that uses credential resolvers, key key info in the message and the trust engine's own logic to evaluate the signature.\nThere are two trust engines supplied in OpenSAML 4, ExplicitKeySignatureTrustEngine and PKIXSignatureTrustEngine. ExplicitKeySignatureTrustEngine validates a signature if the key used to sign a message is one of a number of trusted certificates.\nPKIXSignatureTrustEngine is a different beast in that it does not require a key to be the exact same key that you have, but instead validates trust using PKI. Meaning, the certificate used for signing is considered trusted if it is signed by a certificate you trust. We will not dig into PKIXSignatureTrustEngine right now but focus on ExplicitKeySignatureTrustEngine.\nThe abstract trust engine works like this.\nUse the KeyInfo resolver to get the KeyInfo object from the signature. The KeyInfo object is used to tell the receiver what key was used. The trust engine tries to validate the signature using the supplied key inside the KeyInfo object. If validation was successful. The trust engine gets all credentials it trusts for this sender and validates that the key inside KeyInfor is one of these. If it is not possible to get a key from key info it tries to verify the signature using any of the trusted credentials.

WARNING !!!!!!! It is very important to understand that the SAMLProtocolMessageXMLSignatureSecurityHandler does not throw any exception if the message is not signed only if the verification of an existing signature failed. If the message handler was able to verify a signature it writes this information to the message context and it must then be checked for example like this. 1if (!peerEntityContext.isAuthenticated()) { 2throw new SecurityException(\u0026#34;Message not signed\u0026#34;); 3}\nGet it on Github!

Exchanging metadata between IdP and SP sets up the initial configuration and trust between the two that is later used to authenticate users. For a beginner this can be a quite abstract step, but in this article I will make everything clear.\nThe Metadata is a XML document contain many things. For example end points to be used to authenticate users, bindings(transportation methods) supported, requirements on signing. Also and very important, public keys and certificates that is used to establish trust. More on trust further down. Full specification of SAML metadata is located here\nWhen a SP decides to start using a IdP for authenticating users, the first thing that is done is to exchange metadata. The SP sends it metadata to the IdP and the IdP send its metadata to the SP.\nThe exchange can be done in different ways, but two popular is to either send it using email or to expose it on a web page on the SP or IdP service.\nOnes exchanged, the SP and IdP both use this metadata in their systems for further communication.\nAd Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nWhen the SP wants to authenticate a users, it send the user to the end point specified in the IdP metadata, using a binding also specified in the IdP metadata. Ones the IdP has finished authenticating the user it send the user back to the SP, to the end point specified in the SP metadata, using a binding specified in the SP metadata.\nHow signing of messages is done is also specified in the metadata.\nSo as you see the metadata is the specification of how the two parties can integrate with another and should contain the data needed to that start working together.\nTrust Trust between the SP and IdP is vitally important for many reasons in SAML. First, the more implicit trust is important to understand.\nOnes a SP sets up a integration to a IdP, it leaves all responsibility for authenticating a user to the IdP. The SP just sends a redirect to the user browser and then it goes to the IdP. How authentication then is done is up to the IdP (with some influence from the SP in the authentication request). The next thing that SP sees is the user coming back with a response from the IdP saying who the user is. Because of this it is important for the SP the trust the IdP to correctly authenticate users.\nThe other trust is the cryptographic trust between SP and IdP. In the exchanged metadata, there is also contained certificated and public keys for each party. Some for singing and some for encryptions. Theses are then used to secure all message transport between SP and IdP.\nWhen the SP send the authentication request to the IdP together with the users. It usually signs it. It does so with its private key for the corresponding key in the metadata. When the IdP received the used and authentication request, it verifies the signature with the public key in the metadata previously sent from the SP.\nSame thing, when the IdP responds. IdP signs response with its private key. SP verified with IdP public key in metadata.\nThis way both parties can cryptographically trust that the message received was from the expected sender.\n","link":"https://blog.samlsecurity.com/post/matadata-exchange-trust/","section":"post","tags":["SAML"],"title":"Metadata exchange and trust"},{"body":"SAML messages can be sent using different methods, called bindings. There are four main standard bindings being used today, HTTP Redirect, HTTP POST, HTTP Artifact and SOAP.\nThis tutorial will walk you through how to send a message, specifically a authentication request, using HTTP POST in OpenSAML.\nThe HTTP POST binding The Redirect binding explained here is a popular method of sending messages which relies on HTTP Redirects. A problem with the redirect binding is that the message is send inside URL parameters and URL parameters can not hold large amounts of data. This makes it suitable for SAML authentication request, which is quite small, but less suitable for large messages like SAML responses. The POST binding gives a solution to this.\nThe HTTP POST binding uses input fields in a HTML form to send SAML messages.\nWhen the SP or IdP want to send a message it responds to the current user with a HTML page with the SAML message encoded in a input field in a form. When the browser receives the HTML page a JavaScript or meta tag makes the browser automatically submit the form to the recipient of the message . When the user arrives with its submitted form at the receiver of the message, the receiver will pick the message from the request parameters and parse the message. The HTML form explained A typical POST binding HTML page look like this.\n1\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;body onload=\u0026#34;document.forms[0].submit()\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;noscript\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Note:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Since your browser does not support JavaScript, 9 you must press the Continue button once to proceed. 10 \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 11 \u0026lt;/noscript\u0026gt; 12 \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;http://localhost:8080/opensaml-http-post/receiverPage\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;post\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 13 \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 14\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;RelayState\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;teststate\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; 15\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;SAMLRequest\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;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\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; 16 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 17 \u0026lt;noscript\u0026gt; 18 \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 19 \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Continue\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; 20 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 21 \u0026lt;/noscript\u0026gt; 22 \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; 23 \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 24\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; There are two fields used in this binding\nSAMLRequest/SAMResponse - The encoded, unsigned message RelayState - The relay state, sent in the original request and send back in the response Sending a message using OpenSAML 4 Because this binding is creating a webpage, OpenSAML uses Apache Velocity.

The process starts with a redirect from the SP(The one wanting to authenticate someone) to the IdP(The one authenticating). To start the authentication the SP sends a SAML AuthnRequest as parameter in the redirect. The AuthnRequest message identifies the SP and can contain information about how the SP wants the user to be authenticated. Here is an example how to send the AuthnRequest using OpenSAML. The example uses the HTTPRedirectDeflateEncoder to encode, sign and redirect which makes everything way easier, especially considering encoding and signing. 1//IPR Ergogroup AS 2public void doAuthenticationRedirect(final HttpServletResponse response, final HttpSession currentSession, final String gotoURL, final SAMLMetaData metaData) throws IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException, IllegalAccessException { 3 AuthnRequest authnRequest = generateAuthnRequest(metaData);

If you're looking for an article on OpenSAML 3, you will find it here and if you're looking for an article on OpenSAML 2, you will find it here\nSAML messages can be sent using different methods, called bindings. There are four main standard bindings being used today, HTTP Redirect, HTTP POST, HTTP Artifact and SOAP.\nThis tutorial will walk you through how to send a message, specifically a authentication request, using HTTP Redirect in OpenSAML.\nThe HTTP Redirect binding The Redirect binding uses the function of HTTP Redirects the transport messages between SP and IdP with the use of the user browser.\nWhen the SP or IdP want to send a message it responds to the current user with a HTTP Redirect to the receiver, with the encoded message in an URL parameter. When the browser receives the redirect, it redirects the user to the receiver. When the user arrives at the receiver of the message, the receiver will pick the message from the URL parameter and parses the message. URL parameters explained A typical redirect URL can look like this. 1http://localhost:8080/opensaml-http-redirect/receiverPage?SAMLRequest=fZJNb9swDIb%2FiqC744%2FagSvEKbwGxQJ0Q9C6PewyqDJdC5AlT6TT9t9PzsfQ9ZCLAIqv%2BFIPubp5Hwzbg0ftbMXTRcIZWOVabV8r%2FtTcRSW%2FWa9QDiYbRT1Rbx%2FgzwRILDy0KI6Zik%2FeCidRo7ByABSkxGP9415ki0SM3pFTznBWI4KnYHXrLE4D%2BEfwe63g6eG%2B4k0PDHs3mZa9AKMQgW1Hpy2FQNI550Fp2B8FHnAyxFx3iGRoDyxpJWcLzjahTW0PQcV7olHEsXFKmt4hiTIpk9iNYOcvRHM68tDqUJ7icIAOVHbyFTjbbir%2BW0nVdUVbpGVxnVxflV3X5UVxVaqlass0nWWIE2wtkrRU8SzJ0ihNonTZpLnIl6LIFlme%2F%2BJsd8LxTdsj5kvsXo4iFN%2BbZhfVAV4nFXH2fB5ZEPHTgMShA%2F95MpeLy%2FM4%2BLrpNX6hjwF%2FqDYTpY9tu4o%2Fm%2FzbiZ%2Bh6nazc0arD1Yb495uPUiCipOfApU75wdJl%2FuYb3QbdQepIC8t6mDL4%2FXJ9P%2FVW%2F8F\u0026amp;RelayState=teststate\nThere are four URL parameters used in the binding\nSAMLRequest/SAMResponse - The encoded, unsigned message RelayState - The relaystate, sent in the original request and send back in the response SigAlg - The algorithm used for signing Signature - Calculated signature The authentication request is often the first message send when authenticating a user user SAML.

Searching for SAML and Java you quickly end up in the OpenSAML library.\nIn this tutorial I will explain the basics of OpenSAML to get you as a beginner started. When starting to look on OpenSAML it is easy to feel daunted due to lack of documentation and guides. I how this tutorial will put you on the right track.\nOpenSAML is a software library that helps you to work with the SAML framework, including\nCreating SAML messages, such as assertions, authentication request and response messages, Single LogOut messages and much more Sending messages using SAML bindings including HTTP POST, HTTP Redirect, HTTP Artifact and SOAP bindings Cryptographic signing and verifying messages Encrypting and decrypting messages Much, much more As you are surely staring to understand, OpenSAML is a very powerful and flexible library. This does however dome with some important caveats.\nThe OpenSAML library works on a very low level. Meaning you have to do a lot of stuff yourself. When you use OpenSAML for SAML communication you will more or less be creating all parts of your messages by hand, choosing what should be included. This also means that if you forget something, or implement something incorrectly, like verifying digital signatures, it will not be done and you risk opening up security holes in your code.\nTo be able to create a working and secure SSO service using OpenSAML you should be very familiar with the SAML specification. The specification does not only specify how SAML messages should look but also have thorough rules describing how messages must be validated and processed. In this post I explain the SAML specifications further\nStarting out with the code This is just a small example on how to get started and do something with OpenSAML.

Here you will find all topics, from beginner to advanced that I have collected over the years.\nFirst, for you that are totally new to OpenSAML is a short introduction.\nWhat is OpenSAML? OpenSAML is a library to facilitate working with SAML messages. Below are some of the functions that OpenSAML provides:\nCreating SAML messages Parsing and exporting SAML objects as XML Signing and encryption Encoding and message transport Internet2 provides and supports the library. Shibboleth products, produced by internet2, are one of the examples of identity solutions that utilize the OpenSAML library.\nThe OpenSAML library is available in Java and C++, however; not all functions are provided in both versions. OpenSAML is licensed under Apache 2.0 and the latest version of OpenSAML supports SAML 2.0, 1.1 and 1.0.\nFor the beginner Getting started with OpenSAML 4 - This is a tutorial for getting started with OpenSAML 4, the most current version of the library. In this tutorial I will walk you through, the basics of OpenSAML, adding it to your project and building your first SAML message. It is a good starting point for anyone new to SAML.\nThe SAML Web browser SSO flow Using HTTP Redirect to send and receive messages - This tutorial gives a simple example on how to send a authentication request message (AuthnRequest) using the HTTP Redirect binding. Using HTTP POST to send and receive messages - This tutorial gives a simple example on how to send a message using HTTP POST binding. A popular binding for sending SAML Responses, because of their large size . Resolve an artifact with OpenSAML - Here we look on the second step of the HTTP Artifact binding. When a HTTP Artifact is received, it is exchanged over SOAP to the real message. Often a SAML Response message. Single LogOut Single Log Out with OpenSAML - A post that shows how to build and send a SLO(Single LogOut) request using HTTP Redirect binding. Things needed here and there Convenience methods for OpenSAML - Collection of popular helper methods to ease the load of working with OpenSAML. For example creating and logging messages. Getting credentials in OpenSAML - It is not straight forward how to use private and public keys to do cryptographic operations in OpenSAML. This tutorial walks you through it. Signing with OpenSAML - Signing is the cryptographic way to ensure that a message has not been changed since sent by the sender. This article walk you through how to do this in OpenSAML. Verifying signatures with OpenSAML - Of course, it is not much use to have a signed message if you do not know how to check that the signature is valid. This article will show you how to do it in OpenSAML 4. Books on OpenSAML To dig deeper into OpenSAML and connecting all the dots I have written a book on the subject.\nA Guide to OpenSAML guides you through all steps of using OpenSAML including:\nA basic understanding of Single Sign-On with OpenSAML A migration guide for migrating from OpenSAML V2 to V3 Running sample code to try things out A walk though of steps needed to implement SSO in OpenSAML Usage of popular bindings and useful security features SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation is not really a book on OpenSAML but as you will understand when learning OpenSAML, you need a very good understanding of SAML to build something good and secure using OpenSAML.\nWalking through all topics from introduction to advanced you will learn\nTo fully understand SAML and identity federation Workings of the main building blocks like NameId, bindings and assertions How Single Single-On and Single Logout works in detail Different architectural choices and implementation alternatives Security best practices and considerations Previous security vulnerabilities and what can be learned from them The SAML specs As always, when working with SAML it pays of having the official SAML specs close at hand\nSAML Core Specs - The main spec for the SAML messages SAML Binding Spec - Specs for bindings used to transport the messages SAML Profiles Spec - The profiles showing how to use the SAML messages together for a use-case SAML Metadata Spec - Specification for SAML configuration data Other resource The official OpenSAML homepage - The official page from Internet2.\nJavadoc for OpenSAML - Very useful\n","link":"https://blog.samlsecurity.com/p/opensaml.html","section":"post","tags":["OpenSAML"],"title":"The Big OpenSAML Guide"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.samlsecurity.com/tags/assertion/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Assertion"},{"body":"As you probably should know at this point, the SAML Assertion contains the description of a authenticated user and how it was authenticated. The assertion is generally signed to prevent manipulation but there are also cases where you would want to encrypt the assertion to prevent someone to see the information within. For example the assertion can be used to communicate personal information about the user such as social security number and address.\nAs most people reading my blog seem to be on the SP side of SAML I will explain how to decrypt an assertion.\nThe general method of encryption and subsequent decryption of a assertion uses two keys, one symmetric and on asymmetric. The symmetric key is generated during encryption and used to encrypt the actual assertion data.

This is the SP requesting the IDP to authenticate a user.\nAs in V2 the HTTPRedirectDeflateEncoder is used to send messages using HTTP redirect, the main difference lays in the message context.\nOne of the major changes between V2 and V3 is the message contexts. In version 2, the message contexts where basically one object containing general properties about the message and its destination. In V3 the message context concept has been expanded to be more flexible contain more information. In the new context structure there is a context object per purpose.\nIn my book A Guide to OpenSAML V3 I cover the use of the new message contexts in detail.\nTo sign and send a AuthnRequest, three contexts are needed.\nThe main context is created and the AuthnRequest is set.\n1MessageContext context = new MessageContext(); 2context.setMessage(authnRequest); The SAMLPeerEntityContext and SAMLEndpointContext are created and configured to point to the endpoint of the message.\n1SAMLPeerEntityContext peerEntityContext = context.getSubcontext(SAMLPeerEntityContext.class, true); 2SAMLEndpointContext endpointContext = peerEntityContext.getSubcontext(SAMLEndpointContext.class, true); 3endpointContext.setEndpoint(idpEndpoint); Ad Want to quickly learn and understand OpenSAML?\nHave a look on the book A guide to OpenSAML!\nNext, the security parameters context is created and populated with signing information\n1SignatureSigningParameters signatureSigningParameters = new SignatureSigningParameters(); 2signatureSigningParameters.setSigningCredential(SPCredentials.getCredential()); 3signatureSigningParameters.setSignatureAlgorithm(SignatureConstants.ALGO_ID_SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA256); 4context.getSubcontext(SecurityParametersContext.class, true).setSignatureSigningParameters(signatureSigningParameters); Next, the HTTPRedirectDeflateEncoder is created and populated with context and the http request object.\n1HTTPRedirectDeflateEncoder encoder = new HTTPRedirectDeflateEncoder(); 2encoder.setMessageContext(context); 3encoder.setHttpServletResponse(httpServletResponse); Lastly the encoder is initialized and the message is encoded\n1encoder.initialize(); 2encoder.encode(); ","link":"https://blog.samlsecurity.com/2016/08/signing-and-sending-authnrequests-in.html","section":"post","tags":["SAML","OpenSAMLV3","Digital signature"],"title":"Signing and Sending AuthnRequests in OpenSAML V3"},{"body":"Here is the happy news of the day.

When the user has authenticated with the IdP a SAML Assertion is sent to the SP with the IdPs information about that user.\nAd Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nWhat does a SAML Assertion contain? The SAML Assertion contains some general information like, who sent it, what time it was sent and validity period of the assertion. The assertion also contains statements about a user. These come in three different types.\nAuthentication The authentication statement contains, not surprisingly, information about the authentication of the user. Mainly when and by what means the user was authenticated.\n1\u0026lt;saml:authnstatement 2 authninstant=\u0026#34;2010-11-04T14:04:30Z\u0026#34; 3 sessionindex=\u0026#34;s22428b07e56ce0dbd3f72237ce29c585541db5d01\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;saml:authncontext\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;saml:authncontextclassref\u0026gt; 6 urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport 7 \u0026lt;/saml:authncontextclassref\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/saml:authncontext\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/saml:authnstatement\u0026gt; Attribute The attribute statement can contain application specific attributes connected to the user, for example.

The SAML Web Browser SSO Profile is one of the profiles defined in the SAML specification. As described in my introductory post on SAML, profiles describes how to fulfill a specific use-case using SAML.\nIn the realm of user authentication using SAML, the Web Browser Profile is very frequently used.\nThe use-case being described in the Web Browser Profile is how to authenticate a user that is using a web browser.\nHow does it work? Below is a description and figure of the flow in the profile. As always when using SAML, things can be done in a number of different ways. In the flow below I describe one common way, using the HTTP-Redirect binding for sending the AuthnRequest and the Artifact binding for sending the SAML Assertion.\nThe authentication process could be said to involve five steps\nUser tries to get access - The process begins with a not authenticated user trying to get access to a protected part of the application (SP). Some form of filter is put in place to catch the user. The user is redirected to the Identity Provider(IdP) -When the filter detects a user who is not authenticated, the user is sent to the IdP using HTTP-Redirect. The user is authenticated - This step does not involve any interaction with the SP. The IdP has full responsibility for authenticating the user in a secure way. Authenticated user is sent back to the SP - When the authentication is successfully completed the user is sent back to the SP together with a SAML Artifact. The artifact is more or less a pointer to the user information at the IdP. The reason for using this method could be that it is considered to insecure to send the assertion via the browser. Request user information - When the SP receives the artifact it uses a web service at the IdP to exchange the artifact for a SAML Assertion. This is the actual proof of authentication This is how the federation with SAML web profile works on a low level. This can be good to know when working with identity federation and especially when debugging.\nUsually when you set up a identity federation this is done with one of the many application available for this purpose, for example.

Metadata define things like what service is available, addresses and certificates. Metadata is defined in XML. A SP uses the Metadata to know how to communicate with the IdP and vise versa.\nMetadata is exchanged between the SP and the IDP. There is no protocol how the exchange is done, but there are no secret information in the metadata so the XML can be freely distributed by mail or published in clear text on the Internet. It is however highly recommended that the metadata is protected from unauthorized modification, this could be a good start on a Man-In-The-Middle attack. The integrity of the Metadata could be protected using for example digital signatures or by transporting the metadata using some secure channel(USB, VPN etc) Ad Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nA metadata file for a SAML Web Browser SSO Profile IdP could for example contain the following.\nLocation of its Single Sing On service, Artifact Resolution Service and Single Logout Service. An ID identifying the provider. Signature of the metadata and public keys for verifying and encrypting further communication. The file usually include information about if the IdP want the communication signed or encrypted.\nA metadata file for the SP would contain pretty much the same but instead of Artifact Resolution Service have the location of its Assertion Consumer Service.\nMetadata could contain lots of other information.

I’m planing to write a couple of posts about SAML in the future so first, here is a short introduction in SAML.\nSAML is “an XML framework for exchanging authentication and authorization information.”\nSo basically its a big XML schema.\nSAML is built up of four main specifications. Assertions, protocols, bindings and profiles.\nAssertions, the information This is the actual information being sent, such as credentials, profile information and authorization decisions.\n1\u0026lt;saml:Assertion xmlns:saml=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\u0026#34; ID=\u0026#34;560f83e350ff2cabfa02345ee59153ba\u0026#34; IssueInstant=\u0026#34;2010-11-22T14:30:30.728Z\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;saml:Issuer\u0026gt;me\u0026lt;/saml:Issuer\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;saml:Subject\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;saml:NameID\u0026gt;harold_dt\u0026lt;/saml:NameID\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/saml:Subject\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;saml:AuthnStatement AuthnInstant=\u0026#34;2010-11-04T14:04:30Z\u0026#34; SessionIndex=\u0026#34;s22428b07e56ce0dbd3f72237ce29c585541db5d01\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;saml:AuthnContext\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;saml:AuthnContextClassRef\u0026gt;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport 9 \u0026lt;/saml:AuthnContextClassRef\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;/saml:AuthnContext\u0026gt; 11 \u0026lt;/saml:AuthnStatement\u0026gt; 12\u0026lt;/saml:Assertion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;saml:Issuer\u0026gt; The entity sending the assertion. \u0026lt;saml:Subject\u0026gt; The identity the assertion is about \u0026lt;saml:NameID\u0026gt; The identities unique identifier \u0026lt;saml:AuthnStatement\u0026gt; Authentication information, here only authentication method, PasswordProtectedTransport.

This disables a, even though optional, security feature of SAML, allowing unsolicited responses to be received and considered valid. Obviously this should not be done in production implementations.\nIn this article I will show you what solicited responses are and how you can validate that a response is solicited in PySAML.\nSolicited and unsolicited responses So what is a solicited or unsolicited response? Simply put, a solicited response is a response you asked for, as opposed to a unsolicited response that arrives without you asking for it.\nIn the context of SAML, a un solicited response is a SAML authentication response received from the IdP without the SP first having sent an authentication request.\nThis is allowed in SAML and is also known as IdP initiated authentication, as opposed to SP initiated authentication, when the SP initiated authenticate by sending the authentication request.\nIn order to keep track of this in SAML, when the SP sends a request to the IdP, SP saves the Id of the request. When the IdP send the authentication response back includes the id for the request it responds to in a an attribute, InResponseTo\n1\u0026lt;samlp:Response xmlns:samlp=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\u0026#34; 2 ID=\u0026#34;de8b79c37092487aa7f9c5cb6c5a542a\u0026#34; 3 InResponseTo=\u0026#34;id-5PGmWNaR9dLIoTGOf\u0026#34; 4 Version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34; 5 IssueInstant=\u0026#34;2023-12-02T13:17:14.765Z\u0026#34; 6 Destination=\u0026#34;http://localhost:5000/acs\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 7... 8\u0026lt;/samlp:Response\u0026gt; When the SP receives the response it verifies that the InResponseTo id in the response is the same as the request it sent, ensuring that the response is actually an response to the request that was sent.\nThis is a topic a dive deep into in my book on SAML. Ad Need a complete understanding of SAML 2.0?\nHave a look on the book SAML 2.0: Designing secure identity federation!\nCode The prepare_for_authenticate function in PySAML client returns in addition to the authentication request also the request id for this purpose. Lets store this as key in a dictionary. The value of the entry should be the target for the user was heading to before starting authentication. I the case below we just hard code it to simplify. The dictionary is stored on the HTTP session of the user\n1request_id, authn_request = sp.prepare_for_authenticate() 2session[\u0026#39;saml2_outstanding_requests\u0026#39;] = {request_id: \u0026#34;/success\u0026#34;} Next when we receive the response we parse it using the parse_authn_request_response function of the PySAML client. This function also verifies the InResponseTo id and takes the dictionary we made earlier as a argument of ids of sent requests.\n1authn_response = sp.parse_authn_request_response(request.form[\u0026#39;SAMLResponse\u0026#39;], saml_config.BINDING_HTTP_POST, session[\u0026#39;saml2_outstanding_requests\u0026#39;]) Get it on Github and try it out!
